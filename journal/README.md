# The Search for an Ice Maker

I needed a countertop ice maker and went to [Walmart.com](https://www.walmart.com) because I wanted to see what ice makers were available at Walmart since there is one nearby and I didn't want to wait for shipping. 

On my desktop browser, I went to [Walmart.com](https://www.walmart.com) and on the search bar I typed “ice maker.” I expected to see Walmart’s own products first. Instead, most of the top results were sponsored listings or items “sold & shipped by” third-party sellers that seemed a bit suspicious. This broke my **mental model**, which is the expectation users form based on previous experiences. Since I associated Walmart’s website with buying directly from Walmart, I didn’t expect to see so many third-party sellers mixed in with Walmart’s items for sale.

Some of the listings looked like normal Walmart items at first glance. When viewing the page, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the third-party or Walmart items. The only indication that an item might be from another seller was the small text under the listing say "Free shipping, arrives...". This lack of **visibility** hurts the visibility of system status, meaning that the website didn't clearly communicate what was happening or who I was buying from. Because of this, I had to spend extra time checking each item carefully to see whether it was sold by Walmart or a third-party, and whether it was available to pick it up at my local store. This was seen more when selecting an item and seeing the detail under the pricing (shown in the screenshot on the right side under the "How you'll get this item")

Walmart does have a filter labeled “In-store” (screenshot below on the top left inside the box) but then you must take extra steps in confirming that I was looking at the correct store location. This added friction hinders the **efficiency of use**, which references how quickly and easily a user can complete the task. In this case, a task that I thought was going to be simple and easy—to find an ice maker at my local Walmart through the website—ended up taking longer than expected.

This made the experience tedious and inefficient. It broke my trust that searching on Walmart’s website would show me Walmart’s own inventory. In the end, I did find an ice maker sold in-store by Walmart, but only after filtering and scrolling through many listings.

To improve the shopping experience, Walmart could make changes in the way it advertises items. In this case, in the interface, it could display in more visible letters whether the item is sold by Walmart or a third-party seller. The other thing it could do is make a visible separation between in-store items and third-party items. These small changes would make the process more transparent and efficient for shoppers.
